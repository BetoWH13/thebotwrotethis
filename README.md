# 🧠 TheBotWroteThis.top

> A darkly satirical, AI-assisted website that mocks the very concept of AI — with the help of AI. Built by mistake. Deployed with irony.

## 🧾 What is this?

**TheBotWroteThis.top** is a static parody site designed to resemble an AI-generated confessional, prophecy engine, and mockery shrine. It was created to explore the absurd, uncanny, and occasionally accurate consequences of our obsession with large language models, prompt engineering, and the cult of productivity.

This is a glitch-drenched zine for the **prompt-pilled**, **AI-burnt**, and **memetically aware**.
