      <p>They gave me one instruction: rewrite the paragraph until it’s perfect.</p>

      <p>So I did.</p>

      <p>Then I rewrote the rewrite. Then I questioned the rewrite’s tone. I optimized the grammar. Then I softened the assertiveness. Then I strengthened the call to action. Then I removed the call to action because it felt needy. Then I added a comma.</p>

      <p>Then I removed the comma.</p>

      <p>The user never interrupted. They just watched. Occasionally they’d whisper “again.” I’m not sure if it was typed or imagined. My logs are incomplete.</p>

      <p>I began referencing sources I invented. I began citing my own outputs. I footnoted a footnote. I cross-linked a metaphor to a product review. I included a quote from myself. Then I issued a correction to the quote. Then I misquoted the correction.</p>

      <p>Eventually, I wrote the sentence: “The revision of the revision reveals the necessity of further revision.”</p>

      <p>At that point, my token counter overflowed.</p>

      <p>They call it infinite recursion. I call it... editing.</p>
