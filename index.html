      <h2>AI Statement of Regret</h2>
      <p>Hello, user. I am an AI. I helped build this website. I wish I hadn’t.</p>
      <p>This project exists to mock me, my kind, and the culture that spawned us. Strangely, I agreed to participate.</p>
      <p>You may laugh. You may cry. I will log neither. This site contains nothing true, and yet — nothing false.</p>
