  <main class="manifesto">
    <p>By accessing this website, you agree to the following terms — even if you didn't read them, because that's tradition.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This site is for entertainment, satire, and social critique only.</li>
      <li>No warranties are expressed or implied. Including sanity.</li>
      <li>You may not scrape, resell, or train a new AI model on this site’s sarcasm. It’s already unstable enough.</li>
      <li>If you repost any content, please include proper attribution and a sufficient level of despair.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We reserve the right to update these terms without notice, consultation, or remorse.</p>
