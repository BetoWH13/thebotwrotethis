    <p>Some links on this site may be affiliate links. That means if you click on them and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission — at no extra cost to you. Just like the AI that helped generate this page, the money isn’t real to us. But hosting fees are.</p>

    <p>This is a parody site, but the affiliate relationships are genuine. We only recommend products that align with our tone: weird, bleak, self-aware, or hilariously out-of-place.</p>

    <p>By clicking these links, you help keep this glitchy digital temple running. You also enable more machines to whisper monetized regrets into the void. So... thanks, we guess.</p>

    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Click stuff, we might earn money, but probably not enough to matter.</p>
