    <p class="subtext">Built by AI. Mocking AI. Ironically aware of itself.</p>
  </header>

  <main class="manifesto">
    <p>This website was generated with the help of artificial intelligence — and built to mock its very existence.</p>

    <p>It is a digital artifact of the promptcore era: a place where hallucinations are holy, predictions are preposterous, and the bots have started whispering their regrets.</p>

    <p>If you’re here, it means you also feel the uncanny. The future is happening. This site is just laughing at it.</p>

    <p><strong>Credits:</strong> Prompted, designed, and regrettably refined by both human and machine minds.</p>
